He was found as a stray so we have no history on him. He is learning to trust, loves being petted and having belly rubs. He will follow you around the yard.

       "   'Hi! My name is Flower.  I am a 5 year old female long hair chihuahua mix and weigh 8lbs.  I am a little scared right now as I was left at the shelter and then taken into rescue, so my world is a little flipped upside down.  However, I know that I am going to be just fine and I will find a loving forever home soon!  I am a little shy and intimidated with other dogs right now but I am learning that they are ok from my foster mom.  She is showing me what love is and that I can trust again.  I am a very sweet little girl and with time and patience I promise to the best dog ever if you adopt me.  I am spayed, microchipped, and up to date on vaccines,  For more info or to meet me please contact Diana 702 239 7986',\n",

Hearts Alive Rescue has him now and we think he is very very special! He lived with other big dogs, cats, and children from babies to teenagers before. His old family filled out a paper and they describe him as smart and enthusiastic. He knows his basic commands: sit, stay, down, and come and he always let them know when he had to go potty outside. His previous family say he hides during storms and fireworks but loves his people so much and is very sweet and loyal. Butch caught a bad cold at the shelter and is being treated, but feeling so much better already. He is neutered, up to date on vaccines, and has a microchip.\\n\\nButch is ready to start his next chapter with his new family. Is it you!!?? please email info@havlv.com for interest',\n",

       "   'My name is Doc Holliday. Iâ\\x80\\x99m a lightly aged cocker spaniel who loves walks in the park, rolling in the grass, and obsessively begging for belly rubs from my humans. I might take a bit to warm up, but when I do, Iâ\\x80\\x99m all cuddles all the time. Iâ\\x80\\x99m a good boy in the car and like to go for rides very much! Especially if we are going to the park. Rolling in the grass is my favorite!! I also like to walk through stores like Home Depot and Iâ\\x80\\x99m not reactive on a leash and walk like a good boy. Sometimes I act cranky when Iâ\\x80\\x99m in a kennel but I go right back to being a good boy as soon as Iâ\\x80\\x99m out. For more info or to meet me go to www.ahome4spot.com or text Desirea at 702-525-0518.  or diana 702 239 7986 He is neutered, chipped, and up to date on vaccines.

I have two big foster brothers and Iâ\\x80\\x99m learning the ropes from them and follow them around. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve got lots of energy... I love to run around and play. My sister has been with me too and I donâ\\x80\\x99t think we know how to sit still. ??\\n\\nI do like my food bowl separate from others for now.  Bones and treats, yes please! I love giving kisses, I can be a bit strong with them, so fair warning. I like an assertive figure that will tell me NO and shows me Iâ\\x80\\x99m not the boss. I am only 6 mos old afterall!!  I survived the Korean meat trade so I am behind on my puppy training. ?\\n\\nI really want an active home with another large breed playful pup to be my best friend. ??\\n\\nI enjoy my crate I go in it pretty easily on my own and I havenâ\\x80\\x99t had any accidents.  I will bark if I hear a noise during the night but if itâ\\x80\\x99s nothing I go right back to sleep. Iâ\\x80\\x99m also really great on car rides. \\n\\nSome things still make me a little nervous out in the world as things are still a little new to me, but If you show me itâ\\x80\\x99s ok, I relax pretty quick. I know Iâ\\x80\\x99m a good boy and I know I have lots of love in me for whoever I pick to adopt me!!!  So please have lots of love time and energy for me. I deserve a forever home after all I have been through. ????\\n\\nvegaspetrescueproject.com\\nVegas Pet Rescue Project VPRP',\n",

Iâ\\x80\\x99ll stay in my crate when needed and have some potty accidents that me and my foster mom are currently working on. I pee mostly on the pee pads. I know the basic â\\x80\\x9csitâ\\x80\\x9d command and love treats. Iâ\\x80\\x99m very observative and get anxious at first around other dogs. I love my own space. Me And my human big sis love to hang out together. I will be neutered, microchipped and up to date on vaccines prior to be adopted. To meet me please contact my foster mommy, Destiny, at 702-205-2723  There is an adoption fee.',\n",

Ideal for a family with well behaved children, she'd be the perfect companion for a family who wants a quiet, friendly pet with good house manners. Ella is 14 pounds and 1 and half years old. She was rescued from our local shelter due to a cloudy eye- as of now we are trying to save her eye. We are doing two drops every 8 hours- we will soon know if her eye needs removed. She is housebroken, crate trained, good with other dogs her size, loves a walk, great in the car and extremely sweet.  Ahome4spot call Mandi 702-321-0578\\n\",\n",

She also doesn't mind to just relax on the couch next to you. Carmen loves blankets that she can lay on just the way she likes. She is not a fan of being in a cage at all. She sleeps on the couch instead, but would probably prefer to be in your bed. This is what her foster has learned about her so far! Come see for yourself all this cute girl has to offer! More will be known about me soon.   \\n\\nA Path 4 Paws holds adoption events EVERY Saturday & Sunday from 10am-4pm at C-A-L Ranch,  located at 232 N. Jones Blvd right off the I-95.   Please bring your dog(s) for a meet and greet (if applicable)\\n\\nIf you are interested in Carmen, please contact dogrescuelv@hotmail.com to confirm the dog you are interested in,  will be attending that particular weekend.  We have limited space at the store, therefore we can not take every dog out to the event.\\n\\nCarmen is spayed/neutered, has current vaccinations and includes a microchip, deworming and 2 free vet visits.

Twixx loves to posse at every opportunity and would love to be the center of attention (as you can see from the picture).  He gets along with his four-legged friends big and small. He enjoys having humans around him especially little kids. Cuddling is his favorites activity, aside from eating. He loves the pool and spends his time meditating on his floating throne. Twixx is looking for his forever family who will spoil him rotten. Twixx weighs 20lbs. I am currently enrolled in the Pups on Parole program at the women's correctional facility where I am learning my basic commands. Upon completion of the program, I will be brought out for viewing at Saturday adoptions at Bogarts Bone Appetit, 4985 S. Fort Apache at Tropicana.

This happy boy didnâ\\x80\\x99t seem to notice the burns on his back, shoulder and neck, and just wanted to by a typical, happy puppy. Darby showed us that he already knew how to sit, would happily retrieve a toy, bring it back and give it to you to throw for him again, and also that he knows how to open the lever style door knobs. Darby is also emaciated, so until he is healthy, the vets are postponing his neuter and vaccines. We will keep everybody posted on Darbyâ\\x80\\x99s progress and will also post updates as we learn more about him. So stay tuned and donâ\\x80\\x99t touch that dial!\\n',\n",

Especially after what this precious dog went through. He was found by a Good Samaritan coming out of the desert in the middle of the night. The good Sam did the right thing and had Animal Control come pick him up so his family would have a chance to find him. She then contacted us, letting us know what a great dog he was, after having spent only 7 hours with this dirty, matted, skinny boy. We wanted to help, so we requested him from the shelter. The day before we were supposed to pick him up, he was reclaimed, only to be returned to the shelter the next day. So we contacted the shelter, letting them know we still wanted to save him. (He had been put on the transfer list for being scared the first time he got to the shelter.) He was definitely confused about what was going on, but didnâ\\x80\\x99t hesitate when I opened the back of my car, and he flew in! By the time we got to the vet clinic he was happy, wagging his tail, asking for attention and affection. He is getting all cleaned up and we are getting to know him a little better. Stay tuned for updates on our desert dog, Burgess.',\n",

Sheâ\\x80\\x99s shy at first, but once she feels safe, sheâ\\x80\\x99s happy and outgoing.  Ava is great with other dogs and does well on a leash.  She uses a dog door, or stands by the door to be let out, and has never once had an accident in her foster home.  Ava does best with calm, older children, as little ones scare her.  She enjoys playing with her ball, and she loves being outside when itâ\\x80\\x99s not too hot.  She will bark to defend her yard.  Ava is about 17 pounds.  She rides very nicely in the car and enjoys looking out the window.  She sleeps on her dog bed through the night. Ava loves to be with her people, you can tell because she has a huge smile when you come home!  To meet Ava, please text her foster mom at (702) 366-6391.  She is spayed, up to date on shots and microchipped.  Her teeth look great.  There is an adoption fee.',\n",

Gizmo is mostly housetrained, though he marks occasionally.  He uses the dog door like a pro.  Gizmo isnâ\\x80\\x99t a big barker, though he will bark if someone rings the doorbell.  Gizmo is a special needs dog.  He doesnâ\\x80\\x99t like to be picked up or handled roughly or in ways that make him feel uncomfortable.  Gizmo will not be adopted to anyone with children in the home under 18.  Gizmo likes to be with people on his terms.  He will crawl in your lap and to ask for belly rubs or pets.  He can be food and toy aggressive, so an experienced handler is preferred.  Gizmo is great with other dogs of all sizes.  He likes to sleep on the bed by his foster momâ\\x80\\x99s feet.  He loves cheese and can jump really high!!   For more information on him, please text his foster mom at (702)366-6391.  Heâ\\x80\\x99s chipped, up to date on shots, and neutered.

       "   'What a beautiful girl!  Bella is a little over a year, at 15 months old.  She is a loving a playful girl.  She gets along great with other dogs her size or bigger.  No small dogs!  She can also co-habitat with cats, but does try to play with them.  She is shy at first, and may bark, but she does warm up.  It just takes her a few minutes.  She is a typical German Shepherd, in that she does become protective of her humans.  She knows most of her basic commands and is house trained with a dog door.  Bella would benefit from some training, and would love a home where she is not left alone for long periods of time.  She hates the crate, and being so young, she does still like to chew and tear things up when she is left alone for an extended period of time.  She would also do best in a home with kids over the age of 10 due to her energy level.  If you would like to meet Bella, please email AdoptAnimalNetwork@gmail.com.',\n",

She was being left outside alone while her owner was a work which is probably why she was jumping the fence..she was bored and needed something to do. While a PAWS kennel she has not tried to jump the fence but we are with her at all times so she is not bored. She is a really good dog. Knows basic commands, potty trained, likes to play ball and is very well mannered. She will need a home that will exercise her daily.',\n",

We adopted her from you 7 years ago. She is large and is very loving, however very stubborn and will nip at our friends and jump on them for attention and so we don't know anyone that wants her. She is good with other dogs small and large and is ok with small children however can knock them over easily due to her size so I would say she would be better in a family with older kids. Our two year old can crawl all over her and pull at her hair and she doesn't mind but if she gets in a playful mood she knocks him down which can be scary for some kids.\\n\\nShe needs lots of exercise and attention which she is lacking in our home and with the addition of a new baby it has gotten worse for her. She often has to be locked in a separate part of the house so she doesnt hurt our guests with her jumping and nipping at them and we feel she would be able to enjoy her later years in life in a different home. We are constantly having to tell her to go lay down somewhere because she is just too much around the babies not for being bad just the way she tries to get attention (she leans and pushes on you) ends up knocking them over and hurting them. We have been trying to find her somewhere to go for over a year now with no luck we even posted her on the no kill network back on November 2018 and paid to feature her and no one has been interested.\",\n",

Iâ\\x80\\x99m a bit shy when you first meet me, but I warm up to you quickly.  I love attention and will at times ask for it. I love being with my family. I would love to have a family who will take me on long walks to the park. I weigh 60lbs. I am currently enrolled in the Pups on Parole program at the women's correctional facility where I am learning my basic commands. Upon completion of the program, I will be brought out for viewing at Saturday adoptions at Bogarts Bone Appetit, 4985 S. Fort Apache at Tropicana. Â\\xa0 Please call about my status at 702-227-5555 if you are interested in adopting. Please checkout our Facebook page to see who is making an appearance to Saturday.Â\\xa0Be advised that I may have a waiting list.I like to sleep on Kuranda Dog beds, but we don't have enough for everyone.

This little boy is so beautiful, so special and SO ANIMATED he will brighten up your day with just a look!\\n \\nHere is a little about him!\\nHe is an estimated to be about 4 years old, neutered, up to date on shots. He does suffer from dry eye and will need drops 3-4 times a day in both eyes for the rest of his life.\\nDougie came from our local shelter and has with double eye ulcers one is almost healed while the other one continues to give us some trouble but is healing. He was newly blind when we started fostering him, so he was very scared of everything and how it was presented to him and honestly is a bit scared of things still.  He does get extremely comfortable with his surroundings quickly.  He loves his toys, LOVES company around him, loves short walks. He does well with other dogs if introduced correctly and finds confidence with other dogs around him. We are working on some anxiety issues and potty training; I believe he was an outside dog his whole life. He does have some skin allergies but what bulldog doesnâ\\x80\\x99t! \\n \\nI cannot express how great this lilâ\\x80\\x99 boy is, he so affectionate, wraps your leg up like a burrito and will not let go! He does little dances around the house and loves you each time he sees you a little bit more.\\n \\nIf you are interested in Doug please contact A Home 4 Spot and if you have any additional questions or concerns for me, please let me know!text 702 239 7986\\n',\n",

He loves to be brushed, loves cuddling with humans, playing with other dogs or just enjoying his special bone. He is estimated at 2 years old and is 30 lbs of pure love.

       "   'Marvin is a sweet, good-natured, handsome boy. He gets along well with other dogs, large and small, and he rides dreamily in the car! He sits politely and, if offered the opportunity, will put his nose out to get some fresh air! \\n\\nHe walks well on a leash but sometimes pulls in excitement, particularly if he sees a new dog or person. He sometimes will bark, but with verbal reassurance from his human, he gathers himself and continues politely on the walk.\\n\\nCompletely potty trained, Marvin does not have accidents. When at home with his human, he kindly stands at the front door when he would like to be let out. \\n\\nDespite his age of 6 or 7, he still has energy and does enjoy jogging around or playing with his canine friends. \\n\\nAt home, Marvin loves to cuddle with his human, but he will also curl up at your feet while you read a book or lay on the bath mat while you take a shower. At bedtime, he likes to sleep in bed with you but, if asked, will sleep on his fluffy dog bed right next to you.\\n\\nMarvin bonds quickly and strongly to kind people. While he will go into a crate, when left alone he will scratch at the crate door and howl. When left alone at home with run of the house, he does bark, whine, and howl, while scratching at the door nearest him. \\n\\nHis ideal home would have least one person in the house to be with him most of the time. With some time and consistency, he could gain the needed confidence to be home alone, but being able to have the opportunity to work on his separation anxiety only in short bursts over the course of a few weeks would be most appropriate for now. He is the perfect dog in every way for someone who is able to spend the majority of every day for a while with him, while his confidence and trust bloom.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       "   '\\n\\n\\nMeet Avalon, or as we call her in her foster home, Ava.  Ava is a very sweet 4 year old chihuahua possibly Doxie mix.  Sheâ\\x80\\x99s shy at first, but once she feels safe, sheâ\\x80\\x99s happy and outgoing.  Ava is great with other dogs and does well on a leash.  She uses a dog door, or stands by the door to be let out, and has never once had an accident in her foster home.  Ava does best with calm, older children, as little ones scare her.  She enjoys playing with her ball, and she loves being outside when itâ\\x80\\x99s not too hot.  She will bark to defend her yard.  Ava is about 17 pounds.  She rides very nicely in the car and enjoys looking out the window.  She sleeps on her dog bed through the night. Ava loves to be with her people, you can tell because she has a huge smile when you come home!  To meet Ava, please text her foster mom at (702)366-6391.  She is spayed, up to date on shots and microchipped.  Her teeth look great.  There is an adoption fee.\\n',\n",

I love all people and get along well with other dogs, but can be selective.I have lots of energy and require lots of exercise to keep my body and mind in shape. I like to do my own thing, so setting boundaries is a must.  I enjoy chewing on my bones and toys, but I'm always ready for some loving.  I'm a good boy in need of a loving family with older children. If you think you could be the family for me, than come snatch me up. I weigh 65lbs of pure muscle.

A nice Animal Control officer lady took me to the shelter and now I'm with Hearts Alive Village Rescue. Strange how life can just turn on a dime! I've been to the vet where they treated my ears and discovered my thyroid was in need of support. This new medicine makes me feel better than I ever have before. I'm a big girl at 104 lbs and only 7 years young. I really looooove humans and dogs and cats are just fine in my book, too.\\n\\nI really enjoy a car ride, will try to crawl in your lap for attention, and need a safe and comfy place to call my own.

       "   'Beagly is a 5 yr old male tricolor beagle. He has been with the same family for for all 5 years but has had some typical behaviors that many beagles have and the family could not handle this anymore. Beagly has some food aggression and resource guarding. which means that typically he might need to be fed separately and you have to be very careful taking things from him that he might not want to give up. He also reacts if you touch him while he is sleeping. Beagly has mostly been able to get away and do what he likes due to the fear of getting bit portrayed to his owners. So far we noticed that he is in great condition and is very smart. He picks up learning rather quickly. Beagly likes to play and is a nice dog. He needs a home that will continue to work with him and have patience. No toddlers though. We have been able to work with his food aggression and he has made great strides. He absolutely loves to watch TV.\\n\\nadoption fee is $225. Adoption fees go back to and cover all of the medical for all of the dogs. All dogs are spayed/neutered, vaccinated and micro chipped upon adoption and many have received further treatment for such things as lump removal, severe ear infections, leg injuries, etc.. **Free T-Shirt with adoption, please let us know your size**\\nFor more information or to submit an adoption application, please visit our website at http://www.southernnevadabeaglerescue.com . We are also on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/SouthernNevadaBeagleRescueFoundation . Come meet and play with our available dogs at Las Vegas area dog parks. Times and locations can be found at http://www.meetup.com/beagles-207/ . Contact us or check our Facebook updates ahead of time if you are interested in meeting a particular dog. All our dogs are in foster homes so not all are available to attend all our park meetups.\\nOur meetup group playdates allow you to socialize your beagle with his/her own breed at dog parks with large fenced areas where the beagles can run and play off-leash. Beagle enthusiasts, come bay with us..... AROOOOOOOOOOOO!',\n",

They have a strong desire to hunt, and if you donâ\\x80\\x99t help them fulfill that need, theyâ\\x80\\x99ll go off on their own to see what they can find. On the trail, this is a dog that hustles. Heâ\\x80\\x99ll find a track, push it and get to the tree before all the other dogs. Not surprisingly, he does well in coonhunting competitions.\\n\\nThe Treeing Walker generally gets along well with children â\\x80\\x94 although a puppy can be too rambunctious around toddlers â\\x80\\x94 and other dogs. If you have cats, rabbits or other small, furry pets, beware. The TW may view them as prey. Supervise his interactions with them in the home, donâ\\x80\\x99t leave them alone together, and donâ\\x80\\x99t let them out in the yard together.\\n\\nBear in mind that the Treeing Walker is more gung-ho than some other Coonhound breeds. Health permitting, heâ\\x80\\x99ll enjoy a couple of long walks or runs daily. Heâ\\x80\\x99ll also appreciate the opportunity to run off leash in a safely enclosed area once or twice a week.\\n\\nAs far as training, hounds tend to be independent thinkers who like to do things their own way. They have a short attention span because their interest is always being captured by a scent theyâ\\x80\\x99d like to check out. Assume that if your Walkerâ\\x80\\x99s nose is down, his ears are closed. He is more sensitive, tractable and amenable to training than many hounds, however. For best results, begin training early, keep training sessions short, and use positive reinforcement techniques, never force. The Walker especially appreciates food rewards.',\n",

He's learning so much and making lots of canine friends along the way!\\n\\nYou can apply to adopt him at www.onmywayhomerescue.\\n\\n\\nQuick Dachshund Facts\\nDachshunds are in the hound dog breed group.\\nTheyâ\\x80\\x99re known for their short legs and long bodies.\\nCommon nicknames are: doxies, dachsies, sausage dogs, wiener dogs, and hot dogs.\\nPronunciation of the word â\\x80\\x9cdachshundâ\\x80\\x9d is DAK-sund and not â\\x80\\x9cdash hound.â\\x80\\x9d\\nThere are four sizes: toy dachshund (smallest), miniature dachshund, tweenie, and standard dachshund.\\nTheir average weight is under 11 pounds (toy dachshunds and miniature dachshunds),  11 to 16 pounds (tweenies), and 16 to 32 pounds (standard dachshunds).\\nTheir average life span is 12 to 15 years.\\nThere are three varieties of dachshund fur: smooth or shorthaired; longhaired; and wire-haired.\\nThey come in many colors and patterns.\\nThey were bred to dig and they will dig holes in your yard if you let them.\\nThey have a loud, deep bark that people will assume is coming from a large dog. That makes them great guard dogs!\\nTheyâ\\x80\\x99re considered clever, intelligent, and mischievous.\\nDachshunds are very affectionate. They often bond most with one person and can become clingy, in a cute way.\\nTheyâ\\x80\\x99re stubborn and notoriously hard to housebreak. Vets and trainer recommend crating them on a schedule to solve this.\\nTheyâ\\x80\\x99re not easy to train. It takes a lot of patience, and will include a lot of laughter.\\nTheyâ\\x80\\x99re brave. They show it by barking and sometimes by lunging at other dogs.\\nWhen theyâ\\x80\\x99re puppies especially, theyâ\\x80\\x99ll chew up your shoes, book covers, and other objects.\\nDachshunds are prone to becoming overweight. To keep your doxie healthy youâ\\x80\\x99ll need to monitor his food intake carefully and take him on daily walks.\\nDachshunds love to jump on high things. But they can also develop herniated or slipped disks because of jumping down. So you need to keep an eye on them and place them on the ground.\\nWhen you hold them, you need to give support to their backs with your hand.\\nYou should only get a dachshund from responsible breeders and rescue organizations, which you can research in advance on the Internet.\",\n",

       "   'Recently joining the ranks of the rescue family is Esme, a 8 year-old Mexican hairless girl weighing 6 pounds.\\n\\nArriving at the shelter with 3 teeth, she left the shelter with only 1 because there was a piece of stinky fabric stuck in her teeth and when it was removed, 2 of her teeth came out with the fabric. So...Ms. Esme joins the old lady, \\\\\"tongue brigade,\\\\\" and is getting lots of cuddles and kisses.\\n\\nIf you would like to sponsor Esme\\'s care or apply to adopt her, please visit our website at www.onmywayhomerescue.com or you can donate through our PayPal savethedoxies@gmail.com.\\n\\nThank you for always supporting our rescue mission throughout Southern Nevada.\\n\\nPERSONALITY AND TEMPERAMENT\\nPrized as both a companion and guard dog, the Xoloitzcuintli maintains a calm demeanor even as it remains attentive to its surroundings.  It is an intelligent breed, and generally takes to training easily, as long as the training is gentle and consistent. The Xolo will not respond well to harsh training methods.\\n\\nWhile the adult Xolo is known for being composed and relaxed, the Xolo puppy, like many young animals, is more high energy and will require more daily exercise and attention â\\x80\\x93 and lots of chew toys. If this is given appropriately and as needed and training is consistent and enforced with affection, the Xolo puppy will grow into an admirable and reliable representative for its breed.\\n\\nThe Xolo does retain some of its more primitive characteristics, chiefly as a hunter of small game, so its environment should be one in which it will not be able to easily escape (e.g., high fences, closed gates).\\n\\nHumans have long believed that the Xoloâ\\x80\\x99s warm, soft skin radiates healing energy, so as part of its natural evolution has been in alignment with its human companions, the Xolo has developed  a strong sense of tranquility and patience with humans.  The Xolo is believed to relieve the pains associated with rheumatism and head pains, as well as to help relieve insomnia.\\n\\nCARE\\nThe Xoloitzcuintli needs very little grooming. Generally, a soft, warm cloth to cleanse the skin is sufficient.  Exercise needs are moderate. Daily walks or jogs and outdoor play during warm weather will benefit the Xoloâ\\x80\\x99s health.  Skin care should be undertaken carefully, with regular checks to make sure the skin has not become too dry. Skin care products, lotions, shampoos or anything that has the potential to irritate the skin should be avoided.\\n\\nWith these precautions in mind, keeping your Xolo safe from harsh sunlight, as well as protecting it from cold temperatures will be main concerns. Because they are sensitive to climate, Xolos are considered indoor dogs. They should never be left outdoors for long periods of time. During cold seasons, your Xolo may be more comfortable wearing a sweater, and of course, spending as little time outdoors in the cold as possible.\\n\\nHEALTH\\nAs a result of its natural evolution, the Xoloitzcuintli is a vigorous and healthy breed, with very few health concerns. As previously mentioned, the skin should be protected from chemicals, sun, and temperate changes. When products are needed, stick to skin care products that are specifically formulated for sensitive skin (like baby sun block, baby lotion, etc.). It is always a good idea to check with your veterinarian before using anything new on your Xoloâ\\x80\\x99s skin.',\n",

       "   'Poor Jade has been with the rescue for two years. Jade is a 13 year old Miniature Pincher who was rescued from the local shelter after she was dumped by her previous owners who were having a baby.  Her favorite things to do are cuddle next to her foster parents, hide and sleep under blankets, and go for car rides. \\n\\nJade may be a senior but she has a ton of life left in her and is looking for a home to call her own. She is still spry enough to go to the dog park and go for walks. She recently had her teeth cleaned and her bloodwork shows she needs a kidney friendly diet, which we can supply. She will eventually also need to take kidney medication, which will be covered by the rescue as well. \\n\\nJade is potty trained, her foster home leaves potty pads out when she\\'s going to be gone for extended hours and she uses them. Jade is good with other dogs and doesn\\'t mind sharing her house with a new brother or sister, but also wouldn\\'t mind being your one and only.\\n\\nThis pet is part of our \\\\\"Pips Pals\\\\\" Program. \\n\\nIn March of 2012 we began taking in medically fragile and animals in need of hospice, with our first resident, Pip! However it wasn\\'t until 2019 did we give the program a name and begin to have a focus on those who are so commonly overlooked\\n\\nUnfortunately, our rescue is adoption-based, and that is how we guarantee that we can continue to save lives. But, we could not let these senior and terminally-ill dogs live out their final days in a cold, lonely shelter. So, we started the Pip\\'s Pals Palliative & Hospice Care. \\n\\nThis program relies on hospice foster homes to open their hearts to dogs who will never leave. They will not be able to find a wonderful adoptive family, they will not watch their foster dog transform into a healthy pet, they will never say, see you later,but rather goodbye. As you can imagine, it takes a very selfless, compassionate, and strong foster to do this. Essentially, they are taking these dogs in as their own, and loving them fiercely until it is their time to pass.\\n\\nSay Yes When Others Cannot\\nHospice fostering isn\\'t  cheap, Second Chance covers all of our Pip\\'s Pals medical bills. So, we look to donations to help support this program. Each animal gets special food, pain medicine if needed, various other medicine for eye issues, ear issues, dental issues, etc. as well as ongoing medical care to make sure they are comfortable.\\n\\nWhen the time comes for them to cross the Rainbow Bridge, we believe in their foster home, surrounded by the people (and animals) they love, is the only way to dignify these sweethearts. \\n\\nBelow you will find a list of our current hospice animals. We will keep the ones who have passed on our page as well. They are important. They are loved. Thank you for helping us save them.\\n\\nQuestions? Please email SecondChanceLV@gmail.com\\n\\nIf you are interested in meeting please submit an application by visiting our website, https://www.secondchancelv.org/\\n\\nTo meet  Jade*Sponsored Adoption & Care please e-mail us at secondchanceLV@gmail.com\\n** or view our website, https://www.secondchancelv.org/ to see when you can meet him/her at one of our adoption events. \\n\\nWe are a non-profit organization ran by 100% unpaid volunteers, the adoption fee for each animal is to help offset the costs of running the rescue (medical care, food, shelter, etc) and to ensure that we can continue helping animals.[',\n",

I bet you didnâ\\x80\\x99t know that Iâ\\x80\\x99m quite the people pleaser too.  I enjoy playing fetch, tug-of-war, and chase with my foster sisters, but most of all I enjoy the company of my human.  \\n\\nIâ\\x80\\x99m a quick learner and have already mastered commands like sit, come, kennel, and shake.  Iâ\\x80\\x99m getting better at walking on a leash and my foster mom says with a little more training, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll be a pro in no time.  I am looking for an active family with room to run, as I have lots of energy and love to share.\\\\\" \\n\\nFrom his foster mom:\\n\\nJaymie is a 2 year old Springer-Aussie mix.  He is an active and incredibly smart boy who has a very gentle disposition. He likes to play hard, but settles down easy and wants to relax near his human; you get the best of both worlds with this sweet boy.  He\\'d suit an active person who wants an outgoing and friendly companion - if you can toss a tennis ball or throw a frisbee, you\\'ll have a friend for life.  \\n\\nJaymie has been sharing his foster home with two active female pups (a Springer Spaniel and a German Shorthair Pointer).  He has been an absolute gentleman.  He is house trained as well as crated trained.  He will sleep in his crate all night without complaint.  He knows basic commands and has proven himself a quick learner, so he will excel at obedience training.  Jaymie is happy to be by your side, whether you are going for a walk or a car ride or just lounging around.  Jaymie is driven by praise and is learning that tasty treats are an acceptable form of payment for his good behavior.  He is eager to please and enjoys giving kisses.  He will be a great fit with any physically active and fun-loving family.  \\n  \\n\\n',\n",

       "   'Chica is an Approximate 6 yr female beagle. She came into rescue when her elderly owner had to go into long term care. She is severely overweight and we have her on a diet but her adopter will need to keep her on one until she gets does to a healthy weight.

Now she just needs a forever home dedicated to her healthy and well being.\\n\\nadoption fee is $225. Adoption fees go back to and cover all of the medical for all of the dogs. All dogs are spayed/neutered, vaccinated and micro chipped upon adoption and many have received further treatment for such things as lump removal, severe ear infections, leg injuries, etc.. **Free T-Shirt with adoption, please let us know your size**\\nFor more information or to submit an adoption application, please visit our website at http://www.southernnevadabeaglerescue.com .

Anything she can fit in her mouth that's chewy, she loves! She enjoys walks and playtime with dogs her size. She enjoys sunbathing in the backyard, just make sure she has extra water around! She should not be in a home with cats but is totally fine with dogs her size. She loves to relax and take naps! She is a snorer! She enjoys laying on dog beds and blankets and listens/understands basic commands. She does not like to be crated; she actually Houdini'd her way out of them but is potty trained. She tends to get nervous when meeting guys for the first time, especially with hats but definitely warms up one she realizes they are friends! Overall she is a very mellow girl who just needs a lot of love!\\n\\nFor interest please email info@havlv.com\",\n",

He's a timid boy and defensive when he's in unfamiliar territory but as soon as he's comfortable, he's incredibly loyal and a sweetheart. He loves toys and looking out the window. He's always excited to see you and hates seeing you leave. He's good with kids that are gentle after he is comfortable in his environment. His ears look like they have chocolate chips on them and he never knows whether to keep them up or down, but often it's both. He's always been spoiled and well taken care of.

       "   'Shadow is a 3yd old black lab and seems to need to be in a home with older mature children.  She has never reacted badly to other dogs that we have seen but she does react to cats.  She LOVES going on walks and walks quite well on a leash without much pulling unless something spooks her, like fireworks.  She definitely spooks easy with fireworks as I think most dogs do.  She just needs to be put in a crate and that helps her feel more secure and comfortable.  She is a pretty quiet dog.  She will always give a few barks when someone knocks or the doorbell rings but she quiets down quickly.  She is very protective of her family.  She has never made an aggressive move toward visitors but she will quietly growl at times until she knows everything is ok.  She is house broken.  I do not know if she will use a dog door as we did not have one big enough for her.  We would just let her out throughout the day.  There are times that she has needed to go and she will \\\\\"talk\\\\\" to us and make noises that made it known that she needed something. Our word for relieving herself was just potty.  So we would just tell her to go potty.  The first night she spent with us it took her about 24 to actually go potty until she felt safe and secure. She seems to like going on grass the best.  She is not a very energetic dog as far as playing.  We have tried numerous times playing different kinds of toys and she is pretty uninterested for the most part.  Again, her favorite thing is going on walks. text 702 239 7986\\nPotty trained..walks perfect on a leash....dog friendly!!!!',\n",

This poor girl has obviously had her share of puppies and only 1-1/2 years old. 57 lbs but she still has her milk as her puppies were taken away way too soon.  It is now time she find herself a forever home where she can be a member of a family,and live a happy and healthy life.  Heather is friendly, and she loves people of all ages.  She attaches quickly, and just wants to please her humans.  She is excellent with all other dogs, big or small.  Right now, her coat is dull, but now that she is in a healthier environment, she will begin to shine.  If you would like to meet sweet Heather, please email AdoptAnimalNetwork@gmail.com.',\n",

I like to do zoomies and have fun with toys, but my very favorite thing to do is cuddle with my human friends. There are other big dogs in my foster home and I get along with them just fine. I'm not sure I ever met a cat, but the nice people at Hearts Alive said we can test for that if a home comes along with a feline kid. I enjoy walks and car rides and am a pretty mellow lady.

I can be a bit shy and loud men make me nervous, but I do warm up once I feel safe.  Also, small kids give me the jitters.  I think I'd do best in a home that's kinda quiet and less stressful.

He can also be difficult to housetrain.\\nFrench Bulldogs can be a quiet breed and are not known as a breed that barks frequently although there are exceptions to every rule.\\nBecause they don't tend to be excessive barkers, French Bulldogs make exceptional apartment dogs.\\nAlthough it is important to always supervise young children and dogs when they are together, the French Bulldog does very well with children.\\nFrench Bulldogs make wonderful watchdogs, but they can become territorial. They also like being the center of attention, which can lead to behavioral problems if they are overindulged.\\nFrench Bulldogs are companion dogs and thrive when they have human contact. They are not a breed that can be left alone for long periods or left outside to live.\",\n",

That makes them great guard dogs!\\nTheyâ\\x80\\x99re considered clever, intelligent, and mischievous.\\nDachshunds are very affectionate. They often bond most with one person and can become clingy, in a cute way.\\nTheyâ\\x80\\x99re stubborn and notoriously hard to housebreak.

He is not an obnoxious barker (he has a baritone bark); he may bark if you are outside working in the front yard, but it does not last that long.\\n\\nThe first night here he hopped up on the fosterâ\\x80\\x99s bed, but since then he has preferred to sleep on the floor even over a doggie bed.\\n\\nHe walks well on a leash, but he has playfully lunged at a cyclist, and he acts protective and territorial when there are other dogs on a leash nearby. So attention and firm control with a maximum 6-foot leash is needed.  He does not act this way when at a dog park â\\x80\\x93 heâ\\x80\\x99s very social with new people and dogs.  \\n\\nStewy adjusted to a home with two older male Spring Spaniels quite easily. It took him a day or two to be comfortable with a doggie door and now heâ\\x80\\x99s a pro with it. \\n\\nStewy appears to be deaf or very hard of hearing as he does not respond to his name or any other verbal commands, but he is learning some hand signals like waving for him to come.  Many dogs lose their hearing but their sense of smell is even more important. \\n\\nAdoption fee- $200\\n',\n",

Tiny Daisy weighed only as much as an 8 week old kitten when she came to us through The Animal Foundation. She had a hernia where her bladder was poking out, her poor uterus was full of cysts, her teeth were a horror show, she had a large deflated tumor on her chest, and her blood sugar was 734! She had a serious will to live! She is a survivor and a senior blind, diabetic little lady who has conquered so many challenges\\n. She has gained 1.5 lbs, is eating great and taking her little injections 2x a day like a champ. She is a quiet girl and isn't any trouble. Daisy sleeps a lot and loves to lay in the sunshine and give sweet kisses. If you might be interested in adopting please email info@havlv.com\",\n",

       "   '\\nAt approximately 2yrs of age, little Star found herself wandering in a strangerâ\\x80\\x99s front yard, far from her home.  Star was then taken to Animal Foundation where her family did not show up to bring her home.   Star is such a happy and beautiful little girl and the stranger wanted to be sure Star would be okay so they reached out to A Home 4 Spot who brought her into rescue.   This friendly girl likes to run and play in the kiddie pool, she enjoys her exercise or walk followed by a nice nap.  Although friendly, Star can get a bit nervous when small children are running around playing and making a lot of noise so a home with older, mature, children is necessary.  As far as other pets, we are still getting to know Star but she does seem possibly receptive towards meeting other dogs.   Please complete an interest application at www. ahome4spot.com  and then text Diana at 702-239-7986 to inquire about Star.',\n",

We love to cuddle and spend all our time together.  We have been together our whole lives and would like to spend the rest of them together.  We are microchipped, neutered and have all our shots.

He is curious and puppy-like and is happy-go-lucky, playful, and a little bit of a klutz. He likes to be around people and his tail is always wagging. He is friendly with family members, visitors, and kids (we have a six -year old).\\n\\nRicco aka Lucky needs basic house training and to learn commands. We have been working on potty training, but he is not yet house-broken. He has already learned to â\\x80\\x9csitâ\\x80\\x9d for meal service, and now willingly goes into his kennel when told â\\x80\\x9ckennelâ\\x80\\x9d. He has been working on â\\x80\\x9ccomeâ\\x80\\x9d and â\\x80\\x9cstayâ\\x80\\x9d, but not quite there yet. He is motivated by treats. Lucky needs a patient family who can teach him all he needs to know about â\\x80\\x9chouse rulesâ\\x80\\x9d. Lucky does well on a leash and does very well on walks. He is a great jumper, so if you keep any ball-shaped fruit on the counter, he will retrieve it and play ball; until he learns that counters are off-limits! (real-life situation!)\\n\\nLucky appears to be a great family dog due to his playful nature and would be a good guard dog due to his loyalty and human resource-guarding instinct.\\n\\nLucky is curious about other pets. We have a tortoise and a cat. He will bark at the cat and sniff the tortoise.  I believe Lucky would do well as an only pet. He will defend himself quite vigorously if threatened or attacked by another dog and will not easily give up.

After much soul searching, and endless hours of trying to find a different solution, Shiloâ\\x80\\x99s family has decided to do whatâ\\x80\\x99s best for Shilo, instead of thinking only of themselves. Shilo is a beautiful girl, about 5 years old. She bonds very hard to the one person in her family that she decides is hers. Shilo lives with older children and goes to doggy daycare occasionally. Shilo can be an escape artist and has been known to clear a 6 foot fence, so a secure yard, and supervision while outside is a must for this beauty who loves with all her heart. Shilo will need a family with shepherd experience or experience with herding or working dogs. She will need daily mental or physical stimulation to help her be the best she can be. If you would like to bring beautiful Shilo into your family and home, please fill out our online adoption application. Itâ\\x80\\x99s the first step in our adoption process.',\n",

He is looking for someone patient and realizing that being with humans is not so bad. He gets along with other small dogs very well. He has met a few big dogs that he likes as well. He will do really well in a home with single person because he picks his person but if you are a patient couple then he will do well there too.  Mikey will make a great companion if you give him a chance. He is up to date on shots, micro chipped, and neutered. Please call 720-352-5487 or Diana at 702-239-7986 to set up a meeting. \\n',\n",

In fact, when heâ\\x80\\x99s ready for bed, heâ\\x80\\x99ll go outside and then put himself to bed in a crate. Donâ\\x80\\x99t let his cloudy eyes fool you, he can see most things. We donâ\\x80\\x99t expect his vision to be a problem in the future although he does bump into things every now and then. Bernard loves getting cuddles from a human and doesnâ\\x80\\x99t mind sharing the cuddle space with other dogs.\\n\\nYou can apply to cuddle Bernard for the rest of his life at www.onmywayhomerescue.com\\n\\n\\nQuick Dachshund Facts\\nDachshunds are in the hound dog breed group.\\nTheyâ\\x80\\x99re known for their short legs and long bodies.\\nCommon nicknames are: doxies, dachsies, sausage dogs, wiener dogs, and hot dogs.\\nPronunciation of the word â\\x80\\x9cdachshundâ\\x80\\x9d is DAK-sund and not â\\x80\\x9cdash hound.â\\x80\\x9d\\nThere are four sizes: toy dachshund (smallest), miniature dachshund, tweenie, and standard dachshund.\\nTheir average weight is under 11 pounds (toy dachshunds and miniature dachshunds),  11 to 16 pounds (tweenies), and 16 to 32 pounds (standard dachshunds).\\nTheir average life span is 12 to 15 years.\\nThere are three varieties of dachshund fur: smooth or shorthaired; longhaired; and wire-haired.\\nThey come in many colors and patterns.\\nThey were bred to dig and they will dig holes in your yard if you let them.\\nThey have a loud, deep bark that people will assume is coming from a large dog. That makes them great guard dogs!\\nTheyâ\\x80\\x99re considered clever, intelligent, and mischievous.\\nDachshunds are very affectionate. They often bond most with one person and can become clingy, in a cute way.\\nTheyâ\\x80\\x99re stubborn and notoriously hard to housebreak. Vets and trainer recommend crating them on a schedule to solve this.\\nTheyâ\\x80\\x99re not easy to train. It takes a lot of patience, and will include a lot of laughter.\\nTheyâ\\x80\\x99re brave. They show it by barking and sometimes by lunging at other dogs.\\nWhen theyâ\\x80\\x99re puppies especially, theyâ\\x80\\x99ll chew up your shoes, book covers, and other objects.\\nDachshunds are prone to becoming overweight. To keep your doxie healthy youâ\\x80\\x99ll need to monitor his food intake carefully and take him on daily walks.\\nDachshunds love to jump on high things. But they can also develop herniated or slipped disks because of jumping down. So you need to keep an eye on them and place them on the ground.\\nWhen you hold them, you need to give support to their backs with your hand.\\nYou should only get a dachshund from responsible breeders and rescue organizations, which you can research in advance on the Internet.',\n",

She loves going on walks and is very calm on the leash.  Her father was a purebred german shepherd.  She would do best in a home as the only dog, or with another submissive male dog.  She is an alpha female.  She loves people of all ages and would love to find a new home!  She is 5 years old, and is housetrained and well mannered in the home.  She can be a bit shy at first, but does warm up with new people.  If you are looking for a mellow companion who will love you unconditionally, then look no further than sweet Lady Gaga!',\n",

With the help of his dedicated foster mom, Kristine, he has been learning how to be a dog instead of a ghost flitting around scared constantly. The process can be long and involved, but seeing the progress inch by inch is so rewarding. He's working on recovering in our Make Me Brave program and he's already revealed a quirky and fun side, despite his shyness.

       "   \"Meet Tasha! This mature lady is in need of a warm, safe, and mellow home to spend her senior year's. Tasha is about 15. 2018 was a really hard year for her. Both of her people passed away within 6 months of each other\\n\\nI cannot imagine how worried she was for them through their illness and how lost she must have felt when they'd gone away. Luckily Tasha found a wonderful temporary foster home for the last few months. They healed her heart, changed her food so her hot spots\\nwent away, and gave her furry siblings and a comfy place to rest and recover. Well, Tasha is feeling so well now that she is making some preferences known. One very important objection is to small children. It's heartbreaking because the kids have really tried to be her friend, but she is not having it. Tasha gets along with other dogs and is tolerant of cats if they leave her alone. She just doesn't want to snuggle with them. We are looking for a child free home to help Tasha be as comfortable as she deserves. She is a senior but has not presented with any health issues.

She has had training twice a week and has learned so much.   Lilly would be better as an only pet as she is not friendly with all dogs. But we are always willing to do a meet and greet to see if she would get on with a dog you already have.  We recommend no small dogs. She seems to really love her neighbour Mallory. She needs someone who is willing to continue teaching her good doggie manners. She is a super smart dog and learns fast. A home with older children would be better. With the right training and love, Lilly will make a perfect dog for your family! Lilly would really love to have a family with a large fenced in yard so she could run off some of her energy and chase a ball all day! Come out and meet Lilly and see if you are the fur-ever family for her! Is there no one that will give loving Lilly a home??',\n",

I am set in my ways and can get a little grumpy but I will give my owner lots of love and attention. I am hard of hearing so please dont sneak up on me because it could scare me. I do good with older kids, I love going on car rides, walks and playing with toys. I am good with other dogs and even a cat. So if you would love a loyal cute companion guess what I am the dog for you. If interested contact my foster mom at 702-466-7594  or Diana at 702- 239-7986 or thru ahome4spot.com',\n",

Ryder is deaf but has learned some hand signals.  He also does great in the car, knows how to use the doggy door, and loves visiting Home Depot but snoozing on the couch is the ultimate relaxation for him!!  He loves people and knowing where they are.  He just wants to be with you.  He is best suited in a home where he's not left alone too much and would be best as an only dog.  He does get along with other dogs, but it takes a lot of time and patience to get him used to them especially if living together in the same house.  So, are you able and willing to give Ryder that cushy loving retirement home he deserves?  If interested or have questions about Ryder, contact us at AdoptAnimalNetwork@gmail.com.\",\n",

Fine with tortoises :)\\n\\nBuddy is very insecure and timid and does take time to warm up and does not like to be forced to be affectionate but he is a lover. He likes to sleep on the bed or couch to be close to you and sleeps like no other. Older children are fine if respectful due to him getting nervous with fast movements and is sensitive about his tail being touched. He is very playful with toys and runs fast laps. He absolutely loves going on walks/hikes and does well on leash. He is receptive. He is a low maintenance dog but does have some separation anxiety due to his abandonment fear. No crate for him without a very focus effort to positively train. Right now, he panics if he is placed in a crate or kennel. He loves to be a shadow and he follows from room to room. He likes car rides but is uneasy if he is left along in car and out of sight of his human. For interest, please email info@havlv.com',\n",

She's one of the dogs we take to adoption events because in all the chaos she can stay calm and collected in addition to being one of our more outgoing and charming dogs. She sure does love meeting new people! She loves going shopping and picking out new toys and she's content to play with you or by herself. Panda loves car rides, though she is usually passed out snoring before we've even pulled out of our parking spot! She's a great dog and we know she's going to make a family so happy!\\n\\nPanda is around 3 years old, 65 lbs, spayed, microchipped, and is up-to-date on vaccines and deworming.

Spartacus has since been in training and lives with a pack of dogs, doing very nicely with his manners.

Would be an excellent running dog or a dog that you could play with frequently. He is healing from skin condition. He has to be on a special diet to help him get through it.

       "   \"Winnie's Willow aka Bentley is about  7  yrs old.  Bentley is an easy going love bug. She loves walks and jogs, minus her need to smell everything. She knows sit and shake. Bentley, is not aggressive towards small dogs but doesn't understand other dogs personal space and can be in their face to much. She enjoys lounging and would be in your lap all the time. Nestled against your chest getting petted is a favorite. She also loves giving you hugs. Say the magic word of walk and she is waiting at the door. Uses a doggie door, even ones not meant for her size. Bentley is ready for a super loving home.   More will be known about me soon.   \\n\\nA Path 4 Paws holds adoption events EVERY Saturday & Sunday from 10am-4pm at C-A-L Ranch,  located at 232 N. Jones Blvd right off the I-95.   Please bring your dog(s) for a meet and greet (if applicable)\\n\\nIf you are interested in Winnie's Willow aka Bentley, please contact dogrescuelv@hotmail.com to confirm the dog you are interested in,  will be attending that particular weekend.

They need to be taught all those good things that puppies need to learn in order to grow up to be adult dogs, of course. A puppy is a project! But there's nothing these little ones would love more than to grow right up into your family. This puppy was born in July 2019 and came from an animal rescue group in Arizona. If you're in love, please fill out an adoption survey and let's get started!\",\n",

She's timid at first due to lack of socialization earlier in her life, but she's willing to trust you if you go slow, have patience, and use baby talk along with a few hot dogs. Once Stephanie warms up to a new person, she loves to put her paws in your lap and sniff your face with curiosity. She willingly accepts petting then, and she seems more confident when she's with a canine friend. Stephanie does not feel comfortable walking on leash yet, but she's starting to learn by watching some of her dog friends. Stephanie is looking for a home where she can feel safe so she can let her sweet, silly side start to show. She'll also need time and patience so she can continue to learn to walk on leash and experience other everyday things, like car rides and play time.\",\n",

The family had came to a local vet clinic asking that all three dogs be euthanized. \\n\\nGina is very loving but can be selective about some other dogs.  She is high energy and would make an excellent hiking buddy.  She needs a fenced yard with an active home.  She is not a couch potato!!!\\n\\nIf you would like to meet Gina in person, she will be at PetSmart on Saturday from 12-4.  If you are interested in adopting Gina you can find an application at the link on this site.',\n",

He will press his nose against your leg to solicit petting then and he's really starting to enjoy it. Gino tends to feel overwhelmed when he's outside in an enclosed area and will try to find an escape route so it's important that he has a safe, secure yard along with a family who will take it slow with him when it comes to being in large outdoor spaces.

He would need his potential new family to come meet him at Dogtown to make sure it is a good fit. Although guarding has been a challenge for him, as a single dog in the home and patience from his people, he thrives!

       "   'Butch joined the BAM family having been labeled a 17-year old dog who was likely more in need of a hospice home than typical rescue. Now that heâ\\x80\\x99s in care and has been seen by vets we have the better assessment that he is still a senior, but more likely 10-13. Butch, however, has some neurological defects and impaired vision that can make him seem older. In spite of those physical setbacks Butch has learned how to cope with two groups of five or more dogs in both his foster home and at our adoption center where he spends most of his days. Butch will often motor around with a funny little wobble, but can see shapes or contrast well enough that he doesnâ\\x80\\x99t typically bump into things. \\nOur biggest concern for this little guy is that he ate some gravel and had to undergo surgery to have rocks removed from his system that werenâ\\x80\\x99t moving either direction. This may be something he tried to do again if unsupervised, so we will be quite particular about the home we ends up in to ensure his health and well-being. \\n\\nTo find out more about Butch, text or call Julie at 435.773.5209.  His adoption fee is $100 but Butch is also eligible for our Seniors Helping Seniors Program.  If you are 65 years of age or older, ask Julie about it.\\n',\n",

This low-rider came to live at That BAM Place while suffering with Cherry Eye (it doesnâ\\x80\\x99t look great but is mostly cosmetic) but that is being corrected and after then heâ\\x80\\x99ll be ready for his new family. Dom has clearly lived in a home before and has pretty impressive manners â\\x80\\x94 he does get up on our sofa and is still working on the dog door. Though Dom doesnâ\\x80\\x99t bay like a hound he has a bit of separation anxiety at the adoption center when he has to be put in his kennel while other dogs are out. This would likely be different in a home environment and we do offer trial placements to make sure our dog is right for you and your home.  Dom does not do well with young children.  \\nDom gets along with the wide variety of dogs we have in residence with him, often napping with the smallest 6-pound dog. But Dom wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t mind being an only dog either as he seems to have more connection with our staff and volunteers than with the dogs, and prefers to be with people if given the choice. \\n\\nTo find out more about Dom or arrange a meeting with him, contact Julie at 435.773.5209 by texting or calling.  His adoption fee is $125.\\n',\n",

She also loves to go on walks and car rides, gets a little sad when you leave her behind. She is very choosy on who her furry house companions are because she likes a lot of love so she does best being the only dog, however she doesnâ\\x80\\x99t mind other dogs visiting. Missy is 100% potty trained and would be best with older children because she needs a quiet environment. She is a wonderful dog who will be a great addition to someoneâ\\x80\\x99s family. \\nMissy is a gorgeous blue Cane Corso/Pit blend who was very reserved when she first joined BAM but has begun to come out of her shell in foster care. Weâ\\x80\\x99re sure this means that an adoptive home would get to see even more of her personality shine. Missy would love a person or family that she didnâ\\x80\\x99t have to share with another dog. However, it may just be that she prefers to be the only girl dog in the home, so if you have a male dog and would like to introduce them we can facilitate that. \\n\\nMissy is a medium dog with a lot of muscle, so she would be a good exercise companion and it would help her stay fit too. \\nTo find out more about Missy text or call Julie at 435.773.5209.  Missy's adoption fee is $125.\",\n",

Born in 2014, Sosa was picked up as a stray and came to Best Friends from a shelter in Indiana. Sosa appreciates having a predictable routine. He loves to lounge in the shade after playing in his kiddie pool. He also enjoys breaks in his crate where he can work on one of his favorite things: a frozen treat. Sosa loves doing agility and catches on quickly to new training cues. He's also learning to play with a flirt pole, which encourages him to chase and play with a toy on a long rope while helping him with impulse control. Sosa really likes hanging out with his friends at Dogtown. He's a good role model for other dogs, and he has plenty of play dates here. Sosa is working on getting more and more comfortable when he's out exploring new places. He's looking for a patient person or family who can help him learn about life in a home, since we believe he never had one of his own. Although he may need a slight adjustment period in a home, Sosa is a wonderful dog who bonds well with people and would probably do best with a dog friend to show him the ropes.\",\n",

It takes me a while to make friends but once I do, I will trust you and let you into my inner friend circle. I walk on leash, but I feel much better about it when I'm with a friend. I think with time and more good experiences on leash I can be a walking pro. I'm medium energy so I like to be active and do stuff, but I spend a lot of my time just hanging outside and watching the world go by. I would really love a home that has patience and understanding and will give me the time I need to gain confidence. Having a confident role model to learn from would be super helpful as well. I like other dogs and can be playful once I get to know them. Sometimes if they are too rambunctious, I stay away. Are you looking for a friend like me? I will be your loyal companion for life if you let me!\",\n",

She sometimes gets the 'zoomies' when she's around her caregivers and feeling especially happy. She gets equally excited to snuggle or to go for a walk on the trails. FeeBee was born in 2013. She'll likely have an adjustment period once she gets to her new home, and she'll need time and patience as well as routine and structure in order to thrive. Feebee also needs a person who can introduce her to strangers safely. At Dogtown, Feebee is working on meeting new people outside of her room, and she'll need to continue this training in her new home. At the Sanctuary, she's also working on meeting other dogs to see if she can make dog friends here. Feebee already knows quite a few training cues, and she loves to show off her skills. If you have some time and patience, FeeBee has a lot of potential to share with you.\",\n",

Remington really dislikes brooms and cannot be counted on to help with the cleaning. He is currently working on crate training at the Sanctuary, but he has not perfected the training yet and will not be able to fly to his new residence.

Because he can get overwhelmed at times, his ideal home would be quiet with a family that would allow him to do things at his own pace. He is a great companion who will respect your space and although not overly affectionate, when he is in his element with the people he loves he is happy and enthusiastic.

In the time Trudy has been at the sanctuary, she\\'s grown leaps and bounds with her confidence in meeting people. While she can still be a bit weary of strangers at first, she quickly warms up and becomes a fast friend. Once Trudy is comfortable, she stays right by your side just waiting for pets and attention. She is also a fantastic co-pilot, and settles in on car rides really nicely! For treats, she loves to show off her tricks, like \\\\\"sit, \\\\\"lie down, and \\\\\"shake. Trudy has done really well here living with other dogs and we think she\\'d like a dog companion or two, although in the end, most of her attention goes to the humans in her life.',\n",

Caine enjoys extra cuddles and attention, car rides and long walks. He avoids pulling on his leash while walking although he will attempt to chase the occasional lizard or rabbit. Fortunately, because he's quite person-focused, his attention is easily redirected to his handler when on leash. If the weather isn't suitable for walking, Caine loves a good car ride and knows the etiquette of staying in the backseat. Watch your cheeks though, because he will sneak in kisses from the back seat from time to time! Caine is bound to make a great companion especially for someone with an active lifestyle looking to include a four-legged friend in their activities.\",\n",

Bossco is an enthusiastic about life in general but he gets especially excited to do nose work, a fun search and scenting sport. Since coming to the Sanctuary, Bossco has become an expert at it. Born in 2017, Bossco has some respiratory issues that limit his ability to go for walks with the leash clipped to a collar or certain harnesses, but he is currently trying a new harness that seems to help. He loves to run around in open spaces, do agility and get attention. Bossco gets very jumpy and mouthy when he gets excited, and he can jump fences. He's working on being calm for leashing, not jumping on people and staying calm while getting attention. When it comes to attention, Bossco will want to be the center of it in a home of his own. He would do best as an only pet so you can give him all your love. He will give you all his love in return.\",\n",

He has a lot of energy and would make a great hiking companion, but he also enjoys time alone and knows how to entertain himself. Buster gets overexcited easily and becomes jumpy, especially when people are trying to put his harness on. He can also be reactive toward other dogs while he's on a leash. He has been working on staying calm during times of excitement, and he has developed a routine with his caregivers at Dogtown. Buster was born in 2017. He has some mild skin and respiratory issues, but they don't slow him down. He is very smart and will need a person or family who will continue helping him work on being calm. An active home where he can be the one and only, without other dogs or cats, would be ideal for him. Life is already exciting for Buster, but nothing would make him happier than finding a home to call his own.\",\n",

He also has some sensitivity in his hind end, so he does not like to be handled there and will give clear signs that he is uncomfortable. However, he loves pets around the head and chest. An energetic guy, Daniel enjoys walks and would do best in an active home. Because he can jump fences, he will need a secure enclosure. He would also do best in an adult-only home due to the sensitivity of his hind end and the fact that he has bitten in the past. Daniel can be picky with his doggie friends, but he can live with other respectful dogs. Born in 2017, he came to the Sanctuary from a shelter in Texas. At Dogtown, he is working on crate training and name recognition. In the right household, this sweet and sensitive guy will make a great companion.',\n",

During downtime, he is totally content to play with his toys on his own. Ducky can get very excited and jumpy with people he likes, but he can also get overwhelmed and nervous with petting. Ducky has a history of guarding his food, and he has bitten in the past to protect it. He's made significant improvements with all the training he's done at the Sanctuary, but his new person or family will need to keep working with him.

She was treated for distemper and heartworm here at Best Friends, and she is now healthy. When Water arrived at Dogtown, she was extremely shy and afraid to be touched or walk on leash. She's since learned to walk on leash and is now fabulous on walks. Although she is still shy and fearful with strangers, she is gaining confidence, and she now loves getting pets, especially under her chin. As she continues to learn and understand that she is safe, she has become a super snuggly, wiggly and silly girl. It is so fun to watch her progress and try new things every day. She will need continued training to get comfortable with people, noises, experiences and handling, but she is doing very well and is interested in learning. Her ideal person will be patient, understanding and willing to work with her. Water is generally calm and a wonderful cuddle bug. She enjoys being active, but she also appreciates hanging out and relaxing. On top of all that, she'll keep you laughing with her silly antics and her wiggly dances.\",\n",

Baritone loves to play with other dogs and needs a home with a confident dog who will enjoy his company and help to show him that people and new things are OK. Baritone was born in 2018. At the Sanctuary, he is working on crate training, hand feeding, socializing with volunteers and walking on a leash.

Although she was born in 2008, Sophia has a playful side, which her caregivers discovered when she met a young puppy who became her roommate. Sophia followed her around the yard and wanted to play, which was very sweet to see. She has been considerate to all the other dogs she's met at the Sanctuary and has passed a cat test here. Sophia came to Best Friends from a shelter in Arizona. She would do well in a quiet, low-key home.

She's super smart, enjoys food puzzles and is eager to learn. She has done great learning basic training cues with volunteers. Mrs. Potts can be slightly anxious in new places and cars seem to worry her. As soon as the engine is turned on, she barks and will bark until the engine is off. She will also chase cars if given the chance. Her caregivers at the Sanctuary are working with her to increase her comfort level with vehicles. She can be picky with her doggie friends. When first meeting new dogs, she is very forward and can show a bit of aggression, but if the other dog remains calm and non-threatening she relaxes and loves to play. She is wonderful on walks with her doggie roommates, but she can be reactive and will bark and lunge toward other dogs she sees when she's on a leash. Her caregivers are using yummy treats and training to keep her focused while walking past other dogs. Mrs. Potts was born in 2017. She has an old pelvic injury and may need surgery to correct it. Although she's not in any obvious discomfort or pain, she skips on that leg periodically and should not do strenuous hikes. She'd love an active home with a yard, especially one that has a tall, sturdy fence, and a person who loves to cuddle.\",\n",

He needs time to get comfortable in new places and with new people, but he will accept treats and warm up quickly. He is not yet comfortable being petted or handled by people, but he loves doing activities with other dogs and learning from them. Smokey absolutely adores other dogs here at the Sanctuary. He is very active and playful when he's around them, and they help him build his confidence. Smokey was born in 2014 and came to Best Friends from a humane society in Idaho. He can jump fences, so he is considered a flight risk. In a former foster home, he was a bit of an escape artist, so he will need a home with a secure enclosure and someone with a watchful eye. At the Sanctuary, he is working on crate training, getting into and riding in a car and getting more comfortable with new places. He already walks well on a leash. Smokey will need some time to adjust to a new home, but with time and patience he will make a wonderful companion.\",\n",

Mauve was born in 2012, and she doesn't do much running or playing. She's perfectly happy with short walks. She's very mellow but can get sassy and bark for attention. Mauve is so people oriented that she does not like to share people with other dogs. At Dogtown, she has guarded people and the gate from other dogs. She has some separation anxiety and has previously chewed on door frames when she was alone but could hear people nearby. Mauve came to Best Friends from a shelter in Texas. At Dogtown, she is working on crate training to help manage her separation anxiety. She is also on supplements to help improve her skin and coat. She would do well with a person or family who is home most of the time, so she does not need to be left alone for long periods. Mauve might be your perfect match if you're looking for a dog who'll love to veg out with you. Mauve has a generous sponsor who has covered her adoption fee.\",\n",

       "   \"Apollo was born in January 2018 and doesn't have much self-confidence yet. Since coming to the Sanctuary, he's let down his guard with some of his caregivers. He's still nervous around new people but is a friendly guy at heart. He'll sit next to some folks for petting and share a tail wag on occasion. Apollo is interested in going for walks and will let people to leash him up. At first, he only wanted to walk if his doggie roommate went with him, but he's been working up to solo walks. While he's on the Dogtown trails, he relaxes as he begins to explore all the different smells, and his caregivers have been trying to encourage him to enjoy these outings. Next, he'll be working on getting more comfortable climbing into vehicles so that, eventually, he can enjoy rides too. Apollo has a good appetite and his favorite 'dessert' is cream cheese. He doesn't mind the snow, and during the winter he would chase after snowballs thrown near him. He's done well with all dogs he's met at the Sanctuary and seems to gain confidence by watching them. He still has a lot of puppy energy and would do best in an active home. Because he's shy and fearful with people, he may try to run away, so Apollo will need an understanding person or family to show him that he is safe. Once he gains confidence, he'll make a playful and fun companion. Apollo has a generous sponsor who will cover his adoption fee.\",\n",

At other times he is extroverted, bouncy and playful, and he is funny and endearing with his goofiness. Roper is shy and fearful with strangers, and he can be reactive to them when he is behind a barrier such as a fence. It's usually best to meet him while he's out walking on a leash. Once he gets comfortable with people, he loves to be doted on and to play. Roper was born in 2012 and came to Best Friends from a rescue organization that was closing its doors. At Dogtown he is working on meeting new people with more confidence, and he is having play dates with other dogs to practice his dog skills. Roper would love to go home with a person or family who can continue helping him build his confidence.\",\n",

Other than that, Trix is pretty low-maintenance. She may make you work to earn her trust at first, but once she warms up to you, she's super sweet and will lavish you with affection. She's been great with other dogs that she's comfortable with here at the Sanctuary, and she is very attached to her canine roommates. Sometimes, she's hesitant to go for walks with new people if her dog friends aren't with her. But at Dogtown, she's working on getting more comfortable meeting strangers, going places without her doggie roommates and eating her meals when there are strangers around. Born in 2018, Trish came to Best Friends though local animal control and is ready to move on to a home of her own.\",\n",

He can be a little quirky, and his caregivers say he is like a wiggly cat in a dog's body, but that's what makes him so endearing. Born in 2013, Sundance came to the Sanctuary from a Best Friends Network Partner in Indiana. He guards food and is not comfortable with strangers entering his room or yard. He does better meeting them outside of his area first. At Dogtown, Sundance is doing great with going to his 'place' to wait for his food and with trading his bowls to reduce food guarding. He does not enjoy a lot of handling, especially by new people. He will accept occasional pets but prefers to just do a happy dance around you. He is also difficult for medical handling. He has become comfortable enough with day-to-day handling that he can be harnessed for walks, and he is working on muzzle training for upcoming vet appointments. When it comes to other dogs, Sundance can be picky and seems to prefer females. If you're looking for a dog who dances to his own beat, Sundance would love to meet you.\",\n",

Abner is just learning how to walk on a leash, so he often runs to and fro trying to see and smell everything. He can be reserved at times and playful at others. At Dogtown, he's getting lots of exposure to new things and new situations. As he's gained confidence, he has started seeking attention from his caregivers.

When there are a lot of unfamiliar dogs and people coming and going close by, it is stressful for her. At Dogtown, Eliza is working on learning to trust through hand feeding. She is also working on leash walking, which she enjoys. Eliza is looking for a calm and understanding person or family. A quiet home with a predictable routine and other dogs who can help build her confidence would be best for her.

If you can tire her out, she then likes pets and affection. Born in 2017, Delta came to the Sanctuary from a Best Friends Network Partner. She is reactive to other dogs on leash and would do best as the only dog in a home. She has also exhibited a high prey drive, so we are unsure how she would do around small animals.

Born in 2015, Barat once lived in a home where he spent most of his time outside. Now that he's loved and cared for, he's thriving. He does still have anxiety, which can make him a flight risk, and he's attempted to escape from his yard at the Sanctuary by trying to chew through fences and bend gates open. He does a lot better when people he's comfortable with are around, but he'll need to find a home where he can be in a secure place when his people aren't home. Barat can be picky with his dog friends and will guard crates and food from other dogs. He's also shown aggression toward cats and can't live with them. At Dogtown, Barat continues to work on his social skills with people and on getting comfortable in new places and in the car. He would love to be in a home where he can truly be part of the family.\",\n",

She has a tick-borne illness that causes her to have very low blood platelets. Because of this condition, Josie must be extra careful to avoid any potentially harmful situations. She also lives alone at the Sanctuary and will need to be the only dog in a home, since her condition can be transmitted to other dogs.

Fenway is currently doing a lot of confidence and trust training at the Sanctuary. She is a willing learner, especially if you reward her with yummy treats, and she is learning that new people, walks and car rides are all good things. She has already picked up on leash walking and is learning basic training cues such as 'sit' and 'down.' Fenway would do best in a home with a person or family who understands shy dogs and can give her time to adjust and progress at her own pace.

He's also content to lay on his bed or by your feet while you are hanging out. He's a bit of a comedian and will certainly make you laugh. He's a lot of fun to cuddle and pet. He loves to go on car rides and sits nicely watching the world go by. He's crate trained, housetrained and walks nicely on a leash. Buddha was born in 2010 and came to Best Friends from a shelter in Los Angeles. He has anxiety and cannot live with other animals as he has shown aggression toward them in the past. He can be very reactive to other dogs and will bark, whine, jump or potentially try to escape to get to them. He can also be reactive towards people through a barrier like a door or fence if he does not know them. At Dogtown, Buddha is working on a training plan to help him be less reactive towards dogs. He is also working on calm greetings when people enter his space. The training plan and ongoing support would be provided to his new home. Buddha is on some prescription medications that help him be calmer. He had orthopedic surgery in 2018 and still takes medication for that. Buddha would be the perfect companion for someone who wants a single pet and who is willing to keep working on his training.\",\n",

She is very smart and picks up on things quickly. Although she enjoys long hikes and would make a great hiking partner, she is up for anything you want to do, even if it's just hanging out and snuggling or going for a car ride. With other dogs her size or larger, she has great skills, and she would do well in home with them. However, Francine had an incident with a small dog in the past and can't live with them. She also cannot live with cats. Because of her prey drive, she'll need a home with a secure yard, so she can't escape to run after little critters. Francine was born in 2015 and is working on her crate training at the Sanctuary. Because she is so happy when she is with her people, she will make a great companion.\",\n",

       "   \"Rescued from a property during a dog fight bust in Colorado, Jacko came to Best Friends from a humane society. At Dogtown he is affectionately called 'Jack Jack.' He adores his toys and treats them like his babies, carrying them around and sleeping with them on his bed. Jacko is playful with new dogs once he has gotten to know them, but he also enjoys sunbathing outside with his roommate at Dogtown. Because of his past, Jacko can be nervous meeting new people, especially if he is meeting them for the first time in a small space. He is more confident meeting people outside in an open space and during a walk. Since walks, treats and toys are some of his favorite things, he will trust new people more quickly if they offer him one of these things. He does take treats nicely, and he is eager to learn new things when treats are the reward. Once he is friends with you, Jacko will run right up to you and stop directly in front of your feet to ask for pets and scratches. He can be a very quiet dog and does not 'talk' very much, unless other dogs are 'talking,' too. He is usually a slow walker, but he loves to run when he feels up to it. Recently, Jacko learned to use a ramp to get into a car. He loves lying down and relaxing in the car and is an excellent passenger. Jacko needs a person or family who will show him that it's OK to trust new people. He'll need extra time to meet new people, especially visitors to a home. When he is comfortable, Jacko is truly a clown. He will play bow at people and flash his adorable smile.\",\n",

Conan really needed help getting his allergies under control, and with a lot of hard work and structure, he's finally on the upswing. He is very food motivated and ready to learn new tricks or practice nose work, a fun search and scenting sport. He does tend to shred toys and eat them, so hard toys and chews are best for him. He is crate trained, so he is fine with hanging out in a crate when he is unattended or for nap time. Born in 2009, Conan really likes playing with dogs at the Sanctuary!

She will guard food and during her assessment at the Sanctuary she guarded high value resources. Born in 2012, Coda is working on losing some weight so that she can get surgery for a torn ligament in her right knee. She is taking prescription medication and doing physical therapy to manage her pain, but she currently needs to be muzzled for medical because of her discomfort. Coda has an independent streak and can be a little opinionated when it comes to decisions about which way to go on her walks. She likes to go for golf cart rides and is happy to let the driver choose the route. Coda is picky with her doggie friends and can be reactive at her gate when certain dogs walk by. Currently, most training is difficult due to her medical issues, as she can't 'sit,' 'down,' etc. on cue. However, she is working on her gate reactivity and appears to be housetrained.

However, he settles down nicely when he is in a calm environment. During times of high excitement, he gets worked up around other dogs, but is easy to get him to come back when he hears your voice. At the Sanctuary, Pudge has been working on muzzle training and basic training cues. His caregivers are also teaching him to respond by changing direction when he is about to bump into an obstacle. Born in 2010, Pudge is diabetic and gets insulin twice a day. He also takes medication for his thyroid.

He loves attention and excitement, but he can get nippy if his boundaries aren't respected, so he'll do best in an adult-only household.

He also does nose work, a search and scenting sport, and he enjoys long walks and runs. Blue is an amazing fetch partner and will play ball all day long. He loves doing almost anything that keeps his mind and body active. Born in 2012, Blue can get very jumpy when he is excited. He is looking for a dog savvy and experienced adopter in an adult only home. In a previous home, he has bitten several times. He has also shown aggression toward other dogs and cats, so he cannot live with either of them. Blue has some environmental allergies and is on a prescription diet.

Gilmore feels safer indoors than outdoors. Inside, he will walk around, explore and be active, or just happily hang out, but he is scared of walking on a leash and currently only wants to go out for potty breaks. Gilmore loves food, and he loves to cuddle up in bedding and blankets. He also gets along very well with dogs at the Sanctuary and enjoys being around them.Gilmore was born in 2012 and came to Best Friends from a No More Homeless Pets Network Partner shelter. At the Sanctuary, he loves clicker training and is learning hand feeding as well as how to accept human touch and handling. He's also slowly building his confidence and his comfort level so he can spend more than a few minutes outside in his yard and eventually walk on a leash. Gilmore has a quiet nature and would do best in a calm and quiet home. He'll also need a home that has a secure yard and (ideally) other dogs who can show him the ropes.\",\n",

He can be very affectionate once you're in with him, but he has a history of handling and guarding issues in a previous home, and he has bitten in the past. He has also shown aggression toward another dog, though he has had successful play dates with other dogs since coming to Best Friends, so he may simply be picky with his doggie friends. Domineo is smart and eager to work for food. In a home, he would benefit from a fenced-in yard, as he has a lot of energy. He will be happy to entertain you with his antics with one of his favorite toys, the jolly ball. But he is considered a flight risk and must be watched carefully within a secure enclosure when he's playing outside. At Dogtown, he is working on meeting people appropriately, as he tends to jump up and nip. So far, he has met several people and has done well. He can be a handful for harnessing, but that could due to his excitement in a busy environment. Domineo is looking for a person who will be committed to setting him up for success in a home. If you'd be willing to work with this high-spirited guy, he would love to meet you.\",\n",

       "   \"Phantom is an independent kind of guy. He is an incredibly beautiful dog and can be cuddly on his terms. He accepts petting to a point but then gets mouthy. Phantom was born in 2015. He was rescued and came to Best Friends during Hurricane Harvey. He is an expressive guy in that he's quite the talker, and he's willing to learn new training cues for treats. Although Phantom can be a challenge to harness due to handling issues, his caregivers have found successful methods of harnessing him. Once he is leashed up and ready to go, he's a great hiking buddy. On walks, he often becomes reactive to other dogs. His caregivers have not yet tried him with other dogs on play dates because of his reactivity to dogs on walks. He has anxiety and can go from being very relaxed in his room to running along the fence with his doggie neighbors. He has bitten in the past when he was coming out of sedation. Because of his anxiety, he takes prescription medication. Best Friends vets have tried weaning him off the meds, but he became anxious quickly. Phantom is great in the car and loves road trips. He is currently getting ear drops for an infection. He has shown aggression toward other dogs in the past, so he may need to be the only dog in a home. When meeting new people, he does best on walks or in the dog park, because he is usually too over excited in his room or yard. At Dogtown, he has been working on muzzle training. Phantom is a unique dog who is looking for an understanding home with a very patient and dog savvy person. If that sounds like you, and you're looking for a copilot, Phantom would love to meet you.\",\n",

Coop also really enjoys working on training when he's rewarded with treats, and he loves going on car rides. Coop is very excitable in Dogtown, but he calms down nicely in low-key settings and loves to relax with his person. Coop was not well-socialized and came to the Sanctuary from a local animal control department. He is still young, unsure about the world and very sensitive, so he does best in a consistent environment. Coop needs a patient person who will set him up for success by taking time to introduce him to new things and new people. If you make this boy feel safe then you can bet you'll have a friend for life!\",\n",

He does well with people as long as they aren't too touchy right off the bat and are willing to take the time to earn his trust. Once he's comfortable with you, Dukey is very sweet and likes belly rubs and leaning into legs. He does well with other dogs at the Sanctuary, though he prefers dogs who don't have a rough-and-tumble play style.Born in 2009, Dukey is an overall mellow boy, though he does love going for walks. He's earned a reputation as a professional escape artist, with the ability to jump five-foot fences and to open latches. For that reason, he will need a secure environment. Dukey will also guard food and toys. He has some handling sensitivities around his neck and collar, and he gets very nervous and stressed during medical exams. At Dogtown, Dukey has been working on trading food and other items to help with his guarding behavior. His caregivers are also helping him get more comfortable with handling, medical exams and muzzle training. He's looking for an understanding person or family who will help him feel safe.\",\n",

His favorite two activities by far are swimming in the pool at the dog park and hanging his head out of the window on car rides. When Corban first arrived at the sanctuary, he was extremely fearful when meeting strangers, but with the help of his caregivers and some yummy treats, he\\'s come a long way since then and has become a volunteer favorite! Corban has become our go-to tour dog, who has done great meeting groups in Dogtown and getting treats and pets from them. He has lived with dogs in the past, and enjoys the occasional play date. Recently after his friends have been adopted, Corban has been a little picky about his dog friends he lives with. Corban has an autoimmune disorder called Lupus, which is currently well controlled with a daily dose of antibiotics, and doesn\\'t have any impact on his day to day life. If you\\'re looking for a sweet hiking buddy who can take over a game of fetch when you need to go make dinner and then snuggle up on the couch and watch Netflix with you at the end of a long day, Corban\\'s your guy.',\n",

Ghostrider's favorite activities include hanging out in the sun with his toys or lounging around inside with his humans, being a big couch potato. He also loves car rides. Ghostrider would do best in a home where he'll get lots of love and attention, because he tends to get a little anxious when left alone. On his leash, he'll pull when he sees wildlife, so he'll need a strong person to walk him. At home, he'll need a yard with a secure fence. Although he can have doggie friends, he would do best as the king of a castle with no other animals. Once you meet him, you may only have eyes for him anyway.\",\n",

After lots of hard work and patience, the volunteers and caregivers have been able to get him to come out of his shell. He has several friends now who he loves to spend time with, going on car rides and outings. He'll even walk up to people now in the hopes of receiving a hot dog or other tasty treat! While he still hasn't quite figured out why people like to pet him, he's happy to hang out with volunteers and socialize in his own way. He's even gone on a few sleepovers and found that beds and couches are pretty comfortable, even if it means sharing his space with people. He loves his dog friends, and when he's around other dogs his personality blossoms. Louie is a sweet boy who is looking for a patient home that will allow him time to become as confident as he can be.

Isabel had knee surgery after she came to the Sanctuary, but she's since recovered and has become a rock star at agility. She loves her walks and has great leash manners. Isabel was born in 2014 and has anxiety. She doesn't like when people leave her, and she can be jumpy and mouthy when she senses they are about to go. She would do best in a home with someone who has a lot of time and patience to give her, and where there are no small dogs or cats. Once she settles in and feels safe, some of her anxiety will likely fade. All she wants is someone who will be there for her for life. If you should decide that you're Isabel's someone, she has a generous sponsor who will cover some of her adoption costs.\",\n",

He is treat motivated and truly loves learning new things. He loves showing off that he knows how to 'shake' and how to run through Dogtown's agility course. Since arriving at Dogtown, he has been practicing a training technique during walks that keeps his attention on his caregivers and on treats, making him a very nice walker. Little Bill is not reactive to other dogs, but he does need to be the only pet in a home. He has a prey drive, so smaller animals and cats are just too exciting for him to live with. In the past, Little Bill had some anxiety, but he has adjusted wonderfully to life at the Sanctuary. Although he is still on medication for anxiety, it's likely he could be weaned off of it once he is settled in a home. He loves being with people and leaning into them, and he has no idea that he is not a lap dog. Little Bill has a generous sponsor who will cover a portion of his adoption costs.\",\n",

She is sometimes reactive to new people, but she just needs a minute to get used to them and learn that she can trust them. Sitting with her calmly helps her learn that she can trust, and she loves treats so that also helps her make friends more easily. If you take the time to gain her trust, she'll bond quickly with you. Best of all, once you are her friend, you are her friend for life. Rosamund was born in 2011. She loves to go for long walks, and she also enjoys soft comfy beds, golf cart rides and belly rubs. Although she is reactive to other dogs when she's on a leash, she is working on that with some training. She is also insecure when meeting new dogs and can be picky with her doggie friends. If her potential adopter has a dog, they would need to meet her first to make sure it is a good fit. Rosamund would do best in an adult-only home. She deserves to find a person who can understand her quirks and love her for the sweet and special dog that she is.\",\n",

He is eager to please and very food motivated, and after some treats and a walk, he is a very friendly guy. Stax walks nicely on a harness and leash and has gone through Canine Good Citizen training in the past. He loves being with his special person and enjoys going for long hikes. He really wants to be an outdoor adventure dog. Stax is not comfortable at big events with lots of people, commotion and noise. While living in his previous home, he had an incident where he was taken to a parade, became overwhelmed and bit someone when they got too close to him. He prefers more private events or off-the-beaten-path adventures. Born in 2016, Stax is a true hound with his nose and sometimes with his voice. He loves to do nose work (a fun search and scenting sport) and agility. He is also learning basic training cues at the Sanctuary. Because he is picky with his doggie friends, Stax lived as an only dog at the Sanctuary for a while. But recently he's been living with a shy female with whom he loves to play and wrestle. Shy dogs are his favorite, because he seems to do best with those who ignore him at first, then want to engage over time. He lived with a cat in a previous home and has passed cat test at Sanctuary, but he will chase outdoor cats and lizards. Stax has had a couple of surgeries at the Sanctuary, and he has some food allergies, but with a new prescription diet, he hasn't had any new issues. He is looking for an adult-only home with at least one active person who would like to take him on adventures.\",\n",

Although Lobo had issues with strangers in his last home, he has liked every person he's met at the Sanctuary. Lobo can jump fences, so he'll need a home with a secure enclosure and a person who can keep him safe. Lobo has been successful meeting dogs his size on walks and for play dates at the Sanctuary, but he has shown aggression toward small dogs in the past and would do best as the only dog in a home. Born in 2011, he is likely to be most successful in an adult-only home with a person who can give him the exercise and attention he needs. At Dogtown, he's working on basic manners and getting more comfortable with handling and interacting successfully with other dogs.\",\n",

She loves to be around people and to lean in for cuddles and pets, and it doesn't take her long to get attached. She loves to play with people too. At the dog park, she would rather follow the person she's with than to explore the park on her own. Trinity walks great on a leash and rides nicely in the car. She responds well to positive reinforcement and is quite smart. Although she can be slightly nervous when new people enter her space, she does greet people well. Trinity was born in 2014. Due to a history of aggression toward other dogs, she should be a single dog in a home with no other animals, including cats. She already knows basic training cues such as 'sit' and 'down' and is doing training with Dogtown caregivers to reduce her reactivity to other dogs while on walks. She's also working on crate training and muzzle training. Currently, she eats a prescription diet and takes medication for an enlarged heart. Trinity will be a great companion in a home where she can someone's one and only.\",\n",

       "   \"Skelly came to Best Friends as a puppy mom. She'd never been given a reason to trust people, and she was willing to bite when frightened. Over time, Skelly has made a lot of progress at the Sanctuary. She trusts her caregivers enough to let them leash her up and take her for walks on the trails, which she enjoys. She is starting to explore new places such as Dogtown's indoor agility area and the offices in Dogtown headquarters, where she can experience a more home-like environment. A good way to build trust with Skelly is through hand-feeding her meals. She is still too nervous to get into a car, but she is working on it. She will sometimes eat her meals near a car, which helps her to see that it's not so scary. She also is working on crate training. Because she is still very nervous during medical handling and grooming, Skelly is trained to wear a muzzle during these appointments. She does allow her trusted people to handle her and examine her as needed. Skelly has play dates with other dogs at the Sanctuary, and she has been easygoing with all the dogs she's met. She's also been a good walking buddy for other dogs. She does tend to be a little sensitive and will squeal sometimes if a dog is too rough, so she should live with dogs who understand that and won't scare her. Although she can be hand-fed by those she trusts, Skelly does guard food bowls from people. She has learned to trade them for other items she wants, like treats. She can also be territorial if she doesn't know a person and will protect her space, including her beds and toys. Skelly is looking for a person or family who will take the time to earn her trust and not rush her. A home with a friendly dog would also help her adjust.\",\n",

Although he's had previous heart surgeries, his heart murmur is still a grade five out of six. He takes prescription medication for his heart, and he gets eye drops. Stitch absolutely loves to be around people. He is cuddly, sweet and would make a great couch potato. He can wedge his compact, 60-pound body into his caregivers' laps and snuggle for as long as time allows. He does get overexcited when he's being leashed up, so he is working on being calm and not getting mouthy. He does best in calm, quiet environments and when the person leashing him is calm and follows a routine. Stitch does have a previous bite history. He's also very heat sensitive because of his heart condition and his short muzzle, so it's important that he goes for walks when it's not too hot outside. When it comes to other dogs, Stitch can be defensive when he first meets them, but he usually warms up. He'd do best in a home without cats. Stitch does well riding in a car, although he needs a boost to get in. On hotter days, instead of walks, he likes to ride on the golf cart around Dogtown, feeling the breeze in his face. Stitch is crate trained and eats his meals in a crate. Despite his medical challenges, he is friendly and easygoing with the Best Friends veterinary staff and has been great for medical handling here. If you'd enjoy having a cute little gargoyle who'll curl up with on the couch with you and stroll by your side when it's cool outside, Stitch may be your guy. Stitch has a generous sponsor who will cover a portion of his adoption costs.\",\n",

She loves toys, especially squeaky balls, and playing tug and fetch. She also enjoys going for walks and showing off on the agility course. Because of a rough past, Alice struggled with meeting new people when she first came to the Sanctuary, but she's made a lot of progress. She warms up to women very easily if they follow a protocol that makes her feel safe. It takes longer for her to warm up to men, but if they are patient and kind Alice will usually start to feel safe over time. Alice is picky with her dog friends. On-leash, she can be reactive to other dogs when they get too close. At Dogtown, she is working on doing parallel walks, meaning that she walks parallel to, but a safe distance from, other dogs to learn how to be calm around them. She would need to meet any dogs before going home with them or be the only dog in her new home. Alice is super food motivated and has also learned to accept trades for her empty food bowl due to some food guarding in her past. She'll work hard to solve food puzzles and enjoys the enrichment. She would love to find a gentle person who will earn her trust and build her confidence. Once Alice trusts a person she's super snuggly. She loves to ride in the car and paws at the driver to continuously pet her. Alice has a generous sponsor who will pay her adoption fee.\",\n",

       "   \"Orville has had more than his share of misfortune. Born in 2006, he arrived at the Sanctuary with lumps, bumps and bruises all over his body, and he didn't want to be touched by anyone. But the right combination of medical treatment and TLC has put a smile on Orville's face, a skip in his step and a wag in his tail. Now that all his medical conditions are managed, and he's lost weight and feeling is better, he allows people he knows and trusts to pet him a little. He's even discovered that he likes being patted gently on the head. While Orville guards food and space from other dogs, he is non-reactive and can calmly walk past other dogs. He's also met a few dogs on leash while out for walks and did well when the other dog was calm and non-reactive. Orville takes medication for pain and a thyroid issue. He loves slow strolls, car rides, snacks and splashing around in water. Orville would be a wonderful friend to an understanding person with a gentle touch.\",\n",

He's a dog who really appreciates snuggles and belly rubs. He will crawl right in your lap for love and attention.Although Racko is crate trained and walks very well on leash, he can be reactive towards cyclists and skateboarders and will try and bite at them as they pass. He can also be reactive towards other animals, particularly through barriers like fences and gates. In a previous home, he redirected on a person while reacting to a deer through a window. Racko is picky with his doggie friends and cannot live with cats, as he has shown aggression toward them in the past.At Dogtown, Racko is doing plenty of training to reduce his reactivity. He would do best in an active home with someone who is experienced with working breeds, as he needs regular exercise for both his body and mind.

He has struggled in the past with grabbing his leash and shaking it vigorously while walking. Dogtown trainers and caregivers have been working with him on this and have taught him to hold a toy in his mouth instead. Holy Moly will need to go home with someone who can understand and work with him when he gets tired or frustrated. He has learned impulse control and can usually calm down quickly. He is learning to pay attention and follow many training cues. Holy Moly is an incredibly sweet boy and it's a joy to have him as a companion and friend.\",\n",

She is really smart and excels at training - especially when food is involved. She's become a rock star at agility at the Sanctuary. Because Cordelia is a very shy dog, she can be shutdown and extremely nervous when out of her comfort zone. She doesn't like being touched by people and probably never will be comfortable with that. Cordelia would do best in a relaxed, structured home with a very patient person or family who understands her personality and accepts her for who she is. A home without many visitors would be best. When there are visitors, she would be most comfortable staying in a quiet room so she won't be forced to socialize. She'll also need a confident dog buddy who will be a good role model for her.\",\n",

He excels at training and knows sit, down, shake, bow, pick up, fetch and touch (where he'll touch his nose to your hand on cue). He's crate and muzzle trained and has excellent leash skills. He'll walk calmly right next to you and does not pull. Sargeant Simon has a fear of strangers. He can be reactive toward people he doesn't know, especially when he is behind a gate or other type of barrier. He needs slow introductions in order to be successful. Simon is also picky with his doggie friends, but he is able to have play dates at the Sanctuary with those he likes. He is on medication for minor pain but is otherwise healthy.

She loves to go for walks on the trails, but she feels more comfortable when a dog friend is with her. She also knows how to sit on cue, although she's more comfortable doing that in her room or yard than when she's out and about. Adel can jump in a car and rides very politely, but she prefers to have another dog there with her. This also goes for exploring new places: she will check out the new place but is happier and calmer with another dog there for support. It takes some time to build trust with Adel, but she allows her caregivers to pet her and recently started allowing her caregivers to brush her soft, gorgeous coat. With time and patience, Adel is starting to blossom. She would do best in a home with a confident dog (preferably male) who can show her the ropes and help her feel more secure.\",\n",

She's also a great leash-walker, and while sometimes she can be a bit vocal when she sees other dogs, she has made great progress since being at the sanctuary and continues to impress her caregivers every day.

       "   \"When Wyatt arrived at the Sanctuary from a rescue organization in Arizona, he was feral. He didn't know how to walk on leash, and he was terrified of everyone and everything. Now, Wyatt is still shy and fearful, and is still considered a flight risk. But with the right doggie friend by his side and a patient person to guide him, he really comes out of his shell. He walks on leash nicely now and loves going for walks with his doggie roommate. He just recently learned that the car is not such a scary thing. He will get in the car and go for short rides, but Dogtown caregivers and trainers are still working on getting him to be more comfortable in the car. When he gets comfortable enough around people, he will show his huge and goofy personality. Wyatt was born in 2014. He needs a home with a person or family who will give him a chance, someone who will show him patience and allow him time to get used to a new environment. Wyatt would also do best in a home with a confident dog who can show him that the world is not so scary. He does seem to prefer female dogs over other males. Because Wyatt can jump fences, he needs a home with a secure yard so he does not try to flee out of fear. Wyatt is already crate trained and is still working on his car skills. He has even been learning to do agility with his roommate. Sailing over agility obstacles he was once afraid of has really helped to boost his confidence. Wyatt has lots of potential. Will you be the one who helps him unleash it?\",\n",

Since coming to the Sanctuary, Dilly has made quite a bit of progress. He will now walk on a leash and has learned to enjoy car rides. Though he doesn't show it, he also likes to be petted. Born in 2011, Dillinger gets along well with other dogs, and relies on them for confidence, so he's looking for a home with a doggy friend or two who can show him the ropes. Dillinger is looking for a patient, understanding person willing to give him a chance. If that person is you, Dillinger would love to meet you. Dillinger has a generous sponsor who will cover his adoption fee.\",\n",

       "   \"Kaeli is shy with strangers, and it takes some time for her to get comfortable with them. At Dogtown she has a special routine to follow when being introduced to a new person. Once she gets to know people, she absolutely loves them. Sometimes she wants to be close to you, getting lots of attention, and other times she would just prefer to hang out and do her own thing. She loves walks and turns them into casual strolls, because she loves to take in all the sights and smells at her own pace. She really loves new toys and will show them off by getting the 'zoomies' and racing around her yard. Kaeli will jump fences so she'll need a home with a secure enclosure and a person who can keep her safe. Born in 2010, Kaeli was born in Iran, where her beautiful dark coat was bleached blonde because of a superstition about black dogs. She is on prescription medication for joint pain and is doing hydrotherapy at the Sanctuary. Though the treatments keep her comfortable, she can be sensitive for handling, especially if she hasn't had a chance to get to know someone yet. Kaeli will need an understanding home, because she has bitten in the past when she was pushed out of her comfort zone too quickly. She has also shown aggression toward other dogs and cannot live with them. Kaeli can be reactive towards other dogs when on leash and in the car, though she can sometimes be distracted with high value treats. She would do best in a laidback home with a consistent routine. Kaeli would love a home with a big yard to run around in, or sunbathe in, depending on her mood. In the right home and with a patient and understanding person, Kaeli will make a wonderful companion.\",\n",

He has done well with other dogs at the Sanctuary and enjoys playing with them. He would probably do best in a home with other dogs, as they can make him feel more comfortable.

       "   \"Fred's a guy who likes to take it slow. It takes time for him to form relationships with people and to give his trust. He used to struggle with meeting and bonding with people but has made remarkable progress since coming to the Sanctuary. Once you've earned Fred's trust, the rewards are great. Deep down, he's a very gentle, loving and affectionate dog. He's also extremely smart and responds well to training that requires him to think. Fred was born in 2011 and came from a rescue in Arizona that was closing. He was diagnosed with a spinal condition and takes some medication to help him feel comfortable. Because he's still a bit insecure and anxious, he'll need to find a home with someone who can continue to help him build his confidence, keep up his training and guide him through successful introductions with both people and other dogs. But Fred promises he's worth it. Fred has a generous sponsor who has offered to pay for his adoption fee.\",\n",

       "   'Elwood is a bright-eyed Lab/hound mix who is full of energy and just raring to conquer the world. Born in 2012, Elwood came to Best Friends from a humane society in Wisconsin. As you might imagine, the hound in Elwood has blessed him with an awesome nose and he loves to play \\\\\"find it,\\\\\" while the Labrador in Elwood has provided him with a brain that\\'s eager to learn. In fact, training is one of Elwood\\'s favorite activities. He\\'s already learned commands for sit, down, shake, place, wait and hand targeting! He\\'s an amazing dog. Since Elwood was a pup, he has suffered from noise and storm phobias. This has decreased over time, but has not been eliminated. He also has PTSD from an unfortunate accident that happened at the humane society he was at previously. But when Elwood sees a familiar face, his tail begins to wag uncontrollably and his whole body fills with excitement. He just has to let people know he\\'s happy! He also loves playing with other dogs has lived with a variety of sizes and breeds. Elwood\\'s forever home will need a secure back yard, as his phobias have driven him to jump short fences and open latches in the past. He would do best with a dog savvy, patient person. If you can offer this guy the love and guidance he needs, he\\'ll quickly become your biggest admirer. Will you give Elwood the forever home he\\'s always wanted? Elwood has a generous sponsor who has offered to cover a portion of his adoption costs.',\n",
